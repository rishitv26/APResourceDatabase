# AP Resource Database
This is the AP Resource Database.

## Hello World
This is the AP group for the class year of 2024 (current freshmen). Lets use this place for reducing our AP workload.
I ask all poeple in this group to
- post either usefull recources for AP's
- post one of your own created recources that will help others, If you dont mind :)
- If you really want to, create resources for every individual in a type of field.

**Our goal is to create a full blown database for all AP Resources in one place, so that life in AP is much easier**
